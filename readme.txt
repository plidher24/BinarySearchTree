Program is run using ./a.out

For user:
This program allows a user to insert a array of integers and find the kth smallest element as well as printing the integers as as BST
in in-order traversal method
The User is asked to enter an integer for the k-th smallest element
The user will then next type an integer such as 3
If the input is not an integer nor the length of the array of integers an error message will appear and thus end the program
After correctly inputing an integer the program will run and show the kth smallest element as well as the in order traversal BST
The median is also printed to help the user see what will be in the left subtree and what will be in the right subtree
